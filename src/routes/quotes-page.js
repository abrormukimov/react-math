      Our experience up to date justifies us in feeling sure that in
      Nature is actualized the ideal of mathematical simplicity.
      It is my conviction that pure mathematical construction enables
      us to discover the concepts and the laws connecting them, which
      gives us the key to understanding nature.
      <br />
      <br />
      In a certain sense, therefore,
      I hold it true that pure thought can grasp reality, as the ancients dreamed.
